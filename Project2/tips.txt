Need to generate script that does I/O scheduling that runs on VM

Outputting sector numbers in requested order is good first step

In order to use our scheduler, pass as command line option or use 
	/sys/block/hdc/queue/scheduler file at run time

Ensure using kernel we built (run qemu_stuff.sh or equivalent)

Add some contents to kconfig.iosched file in block directory to get file to 
	compile (/sys/block)

Make copy of noop-iosched.c file, call it what we do, find/replace all instances
	of noop to sstf

Maintain queue in sorted order; use insertion sort to insert in it
	(as already sorted this is OK)
